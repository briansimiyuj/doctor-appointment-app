      - This function will be used to actually create the new appointment once the doctor confirms.

    3. Create a function `triggerFollowUpScheduling` which takes an appointment and a follow-up date as parameters:  
      a. If the appointment or follow-up date is not provided, exit the function and alert the user.

      b. Set the `pendingFollowUp` state with the appointment, follow-up date, default time, and consultation type.  
      - This step is like preparing a draft of the new appointment and showing it to the doctor for review.

    4. Create a function `confirmFollowUpScheduling` which takes appointment, date, time, and consultation type as parameters:  
      a. Call `scheduleAppointment` with the provided appointment details.  
      b. Reset the `pendingFollowUp` state to null after scheduling.  
      - This step finalizes the follow-up appointment after the doctor reviews and confirms the details.

    5. Create a function `cancelFollowUpScheduling` which resets the `pendingFollowUp` state to null.  
      - This allows the doctor to cancel the follow-up scheduling process if they change their mind.

    6. Use the `pendingFollowUp` state to control the display of a modal or review screen, allowing the doctor to edit and confirm the follow-up appointment before it is scheduled.
